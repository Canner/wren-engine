scalar,ltrim,,,,"Trims the specified trim string from the beginning of a string. If no trim string is provided, all whitespace is removed from the start of the input string."
scalar,map_values,,,,Returns a list of all values in the map.
scalar,coalesce,,,,Returns the first of its arguments that is not _null_. Returns _null_ if all arguments are _null_. This function is often used to substitute a default value for _null_ values.
scalar,list_pop_front,,,,Returns the array without the first element.
scalar,log2,,,,Returns the base-2 logarithm of a number.
scalar,cos,,,,Returns the cosine of a number.
scalar,version,,,,Returns the version of DataFusion.
scalar,list_ndims,,,,Returns the number of dimensions of the array.
scalar,rtrim,,,,"Trims the specified trim string from the end of a string. If no trim string is provided, all whitespace is removed from the end of the input string."
scalar,generate_series,,,,"Similar to the range function, but it includes the upper bound."
scalar,array_except,,,,Returns an array of the elements that appear in the first array but not in the second.
scalar,list_push_back,,,,Appends an element to the end of an array.
scalar,named_struct,,,,Returns an Arrow struct using the specified name and input expressions pairs.
scalar,array_pop_front,,,,Returns the array without the first element.
scalar,list_indexof,,,,Returns the position of the first occurrence of the specified element in the array.
scalar,trunc,,,,Truncates a number to a whole number or truncated to the specified decimal places.
scalar,instr,,,,"Returns the starting position of a specified substring in a string. Positions begin at 1. If the substring does not exist in the string, the function returns 0."
scalar,to_timestamp_millis,,,,"Converts a value to a timestamp (`YYYY-MM-DDT00:00:00.000Z`). Supports strings, integer, and unsigned integer types as input. Strings are parsed as RFC3339 (e.g. '2023-07-20T05:44:00') if no [Chrono formats](https://docs.rs/chrono/latest/chrono/format/strftime/index.html) are provided. Integers and unsigned integers are interpreted as milliseconds since the unix epoch (`1970-01-01T00:00:00Z`). Returns the corresponding timestamp."
scalar,list_remove_n,,,,Removes the first `max` elements from the array equal to the given value.
scalar,array_replace,,,,Replaces the first occurrence of the specified element with another specified element.
scalar,list_any_value,,,,Returns the first non-null element in the array.
aggregate,regr_count,,,,Counts the number of non-null paired data points.
aggregate,regr_sxx,,,,Computes the sum of squares of the independent variable.
aggregate,corr,,,,Returns the coefficient of correlation between two numeric values.
aggregate,max,,,,Returns the maximum value in the specified column.
aggregate,covar_samp,,,,Returns the sample covariance of a set of number pairs.
aggregate,count,,,,"Returns the number of non-null values in the specified column. To include null values in the total count, use `count(*)`."
aggregate,regr_avgy,,,,Computes the average of the dependent variable (output) expression_y for the non-null paired data points.
aggregate,bit_and,,,,Computes the bitwise AND of all non-null input values.
aggregate,first_value,,,,"Returns the first element in an aggregation group according to the requested ordering. If no ordering is given, returns an arbitrary element from the group."
aggregate,stddev_pop,,,,Returns the population standard deviation of a set of numbers.
aggregate,stddev,,,,Returns the standard deviation of a set of numbers.
window,lead,,,,"Returns value evaluated at the row that is offset rows after the current row within the partition; if there is no such row, instead return default (which must be of the same type as value)."
window,rank,,,,"Returns the rank of the current row within its partition, allowing gaps between ranks. This function provides a ranking similar to `row_number`, but skips ranks for identical values."
window,ntile,,,,"Integer ranging from 1 to the argument value, dividing the partition as equally as possible"
window,percent_rank,,,,Returns the percentage rank of the current row within its partition. The value ranges from 0 to 1 and is computed as `(rank - 1) / (total_rows - 1)`.
window,dense_rank,,,,"Returns the rank of the current row without gaps. This function ranks rows in a dense manner, meaning consecutive ranks are assigned even for identical values."
