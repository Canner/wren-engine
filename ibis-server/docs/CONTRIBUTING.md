# Welcome to Wren Engine contributing guide <!-- omit in toc -->

Thank you for investing your time in contributing to our project!

Read our [Code of Conduct](../../.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to keep our community approachable and respectable.

In this guide you will get an overview of the contribution workflow from opening an issue, creating a PR, reviewing, and merging the PR.

Use the table of contents icon on the top left corner of this document to get to a specific section of this guide quickly.

## New contributor guide

To get an overview of the project, read the [README](../README.md) and [development](development.md). Here are some resources to help you get started with open source contributions:

- [Basic application structure](../README.md#application-structure)
- [Set up development environment](development.md#getting-started)

## Getting started

### Issues

#### Create a new issue

If you spot a problem, search if an issue already exists. If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a new [issue](https://github.com/Canner/wren-engine/issues/new).

#### Solve an issue

Scan through our [existing issues](https://github.com/Canner/wren-engine/issues) to find one that interests you. You can narrow down the search using `labels` as filters. As a general rule, we donâ€™t assign issues to anyone. If you find an issue to work on, you are welcome to open a PR with a fix.

### Pull Request

When you're finished with the changes, create a pull request, also known as a PR.
- Fill the description so that we can review your PR.
- Don't forget to [link PR to issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue) if you are solving one.
- Enable the checkbox to [allow maintainer edits](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/allowing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork) so the branch can be updated for a merge.
  Once you submit your PR, a Canner team member will review your proposal. We may ask questions or request additional information.
- We may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged, either using [suggested changes](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/incorporating-feedback-in-your-pull-request) or pull request comments. You can apply suggested changes directly through the UI. You can make any other changes in your fork, then commit them to your branch.
- As you update your PR and apply changes, mark each conversation as [resolved](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/commenting-on-a-pull-request#resolving-conversations).
- If you run into any merge issues, checkout this [git tutorial](https://github.com/skills/resolve-merge-conflicts) to help you resolve merge conflicts and other issues.

### Your PR is merged!

Congratulations :tada::tada: The Canner team thanks you :sparkles:.

Once your PR is merged, your contributions will be worked on the next release.
