## 🎯 Our Mission

Wren Engine is on a mission to power the future of AI agents through the Model Context Protocol (MCP) — a new open standard that connects LLMs with tools, databases, and enterprise systems.

As part of the MCP ecosystem, Wren Engine provides a **semantic layer** that enables AI agents to access business data with accuracy, context, and governance. Instead of relying on fragile prompt engineering, Wren Engine embeds deep knowledge of metrics, relationships, and business logic — enabling trusted, explainable, and secure AI-driven workflows.

We believe the future of enterprise AI lies in **context-aware, composable systems**. That’s why Wren Engine is designed to be:

- 🔌 **Embeddable** into any MCP client or workflow
- 🔄 **Interoperable** with modern data stacks (PostgreSQL, MySQL, Snowflake, etc.)
- 🧠 **Semantic-first**, enabling AI to “understand” your data model and business logic
- 🔐 **Governance-ready**, respecting roles, access controls, and definitions

With Wren Engine, you can scale AI adoption across teams — not just with better automation, but with better understanding.
